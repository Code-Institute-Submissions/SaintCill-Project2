# History quiz website
The goal of this project was to create a simple website that is brought to life using javascript. The hope was to create a history quiz that is easy to understand and interractible in the same style as the old wordle games, a quick and simple game that you can play during downtime. The second goal was to utilize javascript for as much as possible. This was to showcase the power and flexibility of javascript when applied to html and css.
