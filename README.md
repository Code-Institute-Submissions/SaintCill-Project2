# History quiz website
The goal of this project was to create a simple website that is brought to life using javascript. The hope was to create a history quiz that is easy to understand and interractible in the same style as the old wordle games, a quick and simple game that you can play during downtime. The second goal was to utilize javascript for as much as possible. This was to showcase the power and flexibility of javascript when applied to html and css.

## Features
The website features several things going on behind the scenes. The answers are all highlighted when you move over them. Once an answer has been chosen, it not only disables the player from choosing another answer, but also shows this by changing the mouse cursor. The correct answer is highlighted in green if the player choses the correct option, and both icorrect and correct answer is shown if the player choses the wrong answer. The next button is also hidden until an answer has been chosen. If the player gets an answer correct, a point will be added and the score is showcased at the end. I have also implemented a feedback button that allows the custom modal to appear.
